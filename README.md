# Project Overview

This repository is a collaborative website project designed to showcase **book reviews** and **upcoming events**. The project is being developed with contributions from different collaborators, each focusing on a specific section. The goal is to create a clean and simple website that can be expanded over time with additional content.

## Purpose and Goals
The project aims to provide users with an easy-to-navigate platform that highlights important sections like book reviews and events. It will be further developed with other sections like **About Us**, **Contact Us**, and potentially a **Blog** or **News** section. The site will grow to include features such as a dynamic events calendar and interactive book reviews.

## Sections Added So Far

### 1. **Book Reviews Section**
- **File**: `book_reviews.html`
- **Description**: The book reviews section is intended to showcase reviews of various books. 
- **Details**: A new file, `book_reviews.html`, was created under the branch **`morgan-book-reviews`**. This page includes a simple structure with:
  - A title for the section.
  - A brief description of the purpose of the page, highlighting that it will include reviews of books.
- **Purpose**: This section will provide an easy place to display book reviews and ratings, allowing future contributors (like Morgan) to share their thoughts on books they have read.

### 2. **Events Page**
- **File**: `events.html`
- **Description**: The events page is designed to showcase upcoming events related to books, authors, and other book-related activities.
- **Details**: This page was created in the branch **`update-events`** and contains:
  - A title for the page.
  - A brief description of the events section, providing an overview of what users can expect.
- **Purpose**: The events page serves as a centralized location where users can check out upcoming events, register for events, or simply stay informed about relevant book-related happenings.

## Branch Workflow

### **1. Branches Created**
The project involved creating two key branches for each contributor:

- **`morgan-book-reviews`**: This branch was dedicated to adding the book reviews section. Morgan contributed by creating the `book_reviews.html` file and pushing it to this branch.
  
- **`update-events`**: This branch was focused on adding the events page. Jamie worked on this branch, creating the `events.html` file, which was then pushed to the branch for review.

### **2. Merging Work into Main**
- Both the **`morgan-book-reviews`** and **`update-events`** branches were merged into the `main` branch. This ensures that all work completed by each contributor is incorporated into the main version of the project.
- The process of merging was done through **pull requests (PRs)** to maintain a clean and organized workflow, ensuring that the code was reviewed before being merged into the main project.

## Key Actions Taken

1. **Initialized the Project**: A new repository was created with a `README.md` file to document the project. This initial setup serves as the foundation for the project's structure.
  
2. **Created and Merged the Book Reviews Section**:
   - A new HTML page (`book_reviews.html`) was added under **`morgan-book-reviews`**.
   - The branch was merged into `main` after the addition.

3. **Created and Merged the Events Page**:
   - A new HTML page (`events.html`) was added under **`update-events`**.
   - The branch was merged into `main` after the addition.
