Comprehensive Explanation of the greenwood-library-website1 Project
Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to the development of a collaborative website that showcases book reviews and upcoming events. The website's objective is to provide users with a clean, user-friendly platform that offers useful features like reading book reviews, discovering events related to books and authors, and participating in upcoming book-related activities. The project is designed with scalability in mind, and additional sections such as About Us, Contact Us, and potentially a Blog or News section will be added in the future. The goal is to create a website that is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and informative.

Purpose and Goals
The main aim of this website is to serve as a centralized hub for book lovers and people interested in literary events. The project provides a simple platform where users can easily access book reviews and stay updated with upcoming events in the book world. It will also be further enhanced with dynamic features like an interactive events calendar and user-generated content such as book reviews, enabling readers to share their thoughts on books they've read.

Sections Added So Far
1. Book Reviews Section
File: book_reviews.html
Description: This section focuses on providing users with insightful reviews of various books, helping them decide which books to read next.
Details: The book_reviews.html file was created under the branch morgan-book-reviews. This page was designed with the following elements:
A title that clearly labels the section as Book Reviews.
A brief introduction that sets the context for the page, explaining that it will feature reviews of books across various genres.
The structure is simple, allowing for easy updates as more book reviews are added.
Purpose: The book reviews section aims to offer readers valuable insights into the books featured on the site. This page will allow contributors, such as Morgan, to add their reviews and ratings, providing a platform for others to learn about the books they are considering.
2. Events Page
File: events.html

The layout is designed for clarity and simplicity, making it easy for users to find event details.
Purpose: The events page serves as a central location for users to view upcoming literary events, conferences, book signings, and workshops. The page will also provide options for users to register or learn more about events that interest them.
Branch Workflow
1. Branches Created
For effective collaboration, two branches were created, each focusing on specific tasks:

morgan-book-reviews: This branch was dedicated to adding the book reviews section to the website. Morgan, the contributor for this section, created the book_reviews.html file and pushed it to the repository under this branch.

update-events: This branch focused on adding the events page to the site. Jamie, the contributor for this section, created the events.html file and pushed it to this branch.

2. Merging Work into Main
To ensure smooth integration of each contributor's work, both the morgan-book-reviews and update-events branches were merged into the main branch. This ensured that all updates and changes from each contributor were incorporated into the main project.

Pull Requests (PRs) were used to manage the merging process. This approach maintained the integrity of the codebase, allowing for thorough code reviews and ensuring that any issues were addressed before merging.
Key Actions Taken
